          <p>
              We're excited to announce that our application now integrates with Google Places for address input! This new feature enhances the accuracy and convenience of entering addresses.

          <p>
              A new Icon JSON Toggle feature has been added to give you more control over the icons in the application. With this toggle, you can easily switch between different icon sets or customize icons based on your preferences. This feature is especially useful for developers and designers who want to tailor the visual elements of the application to better suit their needs.
